To compile/run:
python game.py

You will be asked for a starting scenario number. Enter a number from 0 to 10000; you will then be judging consecutive scenarios from that number.

Press 'w' if you think the right paddle should move *up* based on the current trajectory of the ball. Press 's' if you think it should move *down*. Press 'd' if you either are not sure or think it can remain still.

Press 'p' once you are finished. Once you press 'p', info about your playtest should be saved to humandata.txt. Please send this text file to dwhatley@mit.edu.

Requires Python 3.6 or later. If you need Python 3.5 support, change the f-string on game.py:40 to a vanilla string concatenation.

Requires Matplotlib.

Do not modify games.txt.

Please do not ask for help compiling or running the code. I am not responsible for anything that happens to your machine as a result of running the code.

DO NOT WRITE ANY MACHINE LEARNING / AUTOMATED PROCESSES TO GENERATE RESULTS. If your submission is clearly frivolous, it will be denied.
